# Password-Generator
Hello & welcome to my fully-functioning password generator! In this function, you will be able to create a random password after answering five questions. The first will ask how many characters you want the password to be, and the other four will ask about the variable characters that will be included in the password. This file was created with an mix of HTML, CSS & Javascript.

## Credit
Credit obviously needs to be passed along to the W3 & StackOverflow resources utilized (though all code is original), as well as the various TA's & tutors supplied by UNC's bootcamp.
